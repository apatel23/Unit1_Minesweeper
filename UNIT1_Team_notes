# Cell class
# 2-D array of board cells
# Bomb cells have adjacency list 
# Number determines cell status: -1 bomb, 0 empty, 1-8 mines nearby
# Boolean for visible/not visible, Boolean for blacked out cell
# Upon start, first cell needs to be empty cell or number not -1 (cant be mine), reveal cell after clicked
# Board generation randomly places bombs (no bombs next to each other), once placed board will be hidden
# getX, getY: check if cell is bomb, if not bomb: check remaining cells, check hidden cells
# Draw board everytime a cell is clicked, Draw cell when state of cell has changed
